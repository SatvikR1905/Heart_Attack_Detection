# Heart_Attack_Detection
# Abstract:
Early detection of heart attack, plays a
crucial role in preventing serious complications and
improving patient outcomes. This paper presents a
study on the use of machine learning algorithms for
early heart attack detection. The dataset used in this
study includes patient information such as age, sex,
chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol
level, and other relevant attributes. Various machine
learning algorithms, including Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), and Decision Tree, were applied to predict
the likelihood of heart disease. The SVM algorithm
showed the highest accuracy score and was selected
for further analysis. The performance of the SVM
model was evaluated using a confusion matrix,
classification accuracy, and error. The results
demonstrate the potential of machine learning in
accurately identifying patients with heart disease
based on medical factors. The findings of this study
contribute to the development of an effective early
heart attack detection system.

# Heart_Attack_Detection
# Abstract:
Early detection of heart attack, plays a
crucial role in preventing serious complications and
improving patient outcomes. This paper presents a
study on the use of machine learning algorithms for
early heart attack detection. The dataset used in this
study includes patient information such as age, sex,
chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol
level, and other relevant attributes. Various machine
learning algorithms, including Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), and Decision Tree, were applied to predict
the likelihood of heart disease. The SVM algorithm
showed the highest accuracy score and was selected
for further analysis. The performance of the SVM
model was evaluated using a confusion matrix,
classification accuracy, and error. The results
demonstrate the potential of machine learning in
accurately identifying patients with heart disease
based on medical factors. The findings of this study
contribute to the development of an effective early
heart attack detection system.

# Objectives
1. The objective of the machine learning code is to
develop a classification model that can predict the
presence or absence of heart disease based on
various health indicators.
2. Exploratory data analysis was performed to
visualize the relationships between different
variables and heart disease.
3. Data pre-processing was done to handle missing
values and categorical variables were converted into
dummy variables.
4. Four different classification algorithms were
applied to the pre-processed data, including Naive
Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector
Machines, and Decision Trees.
5. The performance of each model was evaluated
using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and
classification reports.
6. Based on the evaluation, the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) model was chosen as the final
model with the highest accuracy score.
